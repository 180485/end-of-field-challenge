End-of-field-challenge (BeCode)

This project is mean to see how far our skill on css . so i had no 03 and NO.2O

for exercise no 3 i made class in every element at my html make me easier to styling at CSS i always had trouble with padding and margin 

FOR exercise no 20 I had some trouble with the fonts, finding the right font and styling it properly. and this looks simple but is really tricky i spent like hours hours to finish this in the end i used <span> to styling paraghap maybe isnt prefect but i do my best.
